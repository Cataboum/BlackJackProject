This project is the first of the Hackiflette team !

This game is a famous card game, **Black Jack**. It will have the possibility to be played with friends, in a multiplayer mode, on the same computer, or maybe on differents computer on the same network.

# The Hackiflette team

We are 8 friends  who liked programming, and playing. So we created Hackiflette to develop games and improve our programing skills.
For our first project, we decided to develop a simple card game : Black Jack is our final choice.

# How to play !?

Our project is a python project, so for now you need to have python installed on your computer to launch it.
You also need :

After download the project, you just have to launch the main.py in the src directory.
You can also find a game example using pygame, created by @deplanty, by launching the main.py in the ExamplePygame/Stars directory.
