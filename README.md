# The Hackiflette team

We are 8 friends who liked programming, and playing. So we created Hackiflette to develop games and improve our programing skills.
For our first project, we decided to develop a simple card game : Black Jack is our final choice.

# How to play !?

Our project is a python project, so for now you need to have python (version >= 3.5) installed on your computer to launch it.
You also need the following packages:
* pygame = 1.9.4
* marshmallow = 2.19.5
* typing = 3.6.6
